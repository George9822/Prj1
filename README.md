# Text Editor
It's a text editor made in C, using data structures, algorithms, file handling, pointers, and dynamic allocations. 

The role of this program is to mimic a text editor ( like Notepad ) with basic functions: cursor move, copy, delete, word insertion, backspace, paste, undo and redo. 

These functions are specified in a text file along with the desired arguments that depend on the selected function.
